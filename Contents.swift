// Classes VS Structures
/* Classes and Structures have a lot in common but there are two important differences.
   Classes can inherit from other classes.
   Classes are reference types and structs are value types. If you make a copy of a struct object and change this copy, the original object won't be changed.
   On classes if you create a copy of a class object and change it, the original object will also change.
